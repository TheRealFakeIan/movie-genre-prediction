# Movie Genre Prediction using Audio, Visual and Text Features

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and critically analyse some supervised Machine Learning algorithms, to automatically identify the genre(s) of a movie on the basis of its audio, visual and textual (metadata) features. Specifically, given a list of movies, the aim is to benchmark the performance of several machine learning models, which are trained using the training dataset, and evaluated using the validation and test dataset.
